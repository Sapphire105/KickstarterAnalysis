# Kickstarter Analysis

In this notebook, we are going to be taking a look at data of fundraising campaigns for art projects on the Kickstarter website.
The idea is to explore and get an intuition of what the data says by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python's NumPy library. Further, we will be plotting the relationships between variables using matplotlib and seaborn. The EDA can help us learn the different variables used to characterize a fundraising campaign and how they're related to each other. And most importantly, we want to understand how these variables influence the result of the campaign which will ultimately provide insight into how, on average, is effective Kickstarter in helping artists reach their funding objectives.
